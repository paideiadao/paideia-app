Welcome to the Paideia App repository. This project uses Next.js, React, and Material-UI to deliver a responsive web application tailored for efficient management and participation in decentralized organizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

Check your Node.js and npm installation by running the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
